A for loop iterates from 0 to 100 in steps of 10, and in each iteration, it prints the text "progress {x}%", where {x} represents the current iteration value. The end='\r' parameter means that instead of printing a new line, the cursor moves back to the beginning of the line, so the message gets updated in place, and messages don't accumulate. The flush=True parameter ensures that messages appear immediately on the console without waiting for the standard output buffer to flush.

import time
for x in range(0, 100, 10):
    print(input, end='\r', flush=True)
    time.sleep(0.3)

fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'cherry', 'strawberry']

Extract all elements.
print(fruits)

Extract all elements after 'apple'.
print(fruits[1:])

Extract elements between 'orange' and 'strawberry'.
print(fruits[2:3])

The -1 index refers to the last element in the list.
print(fruits[-1:])

We can extract the last x elements.
print(fruits[-2:])

If we want to print the elements in reverse order, we need to display the list in reversed order. This can be done using the reversed() function or with the [::-1] syntax. The [::-1] syntax reverses the list and returns the reversed list.
print(list(reversed(fruits)))
print(fruits[::-1])
